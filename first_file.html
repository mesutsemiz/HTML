HTML Div Tag
A <div> section in a document that is styled with CSS:

The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.

Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag!

Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the <div> element.
